Viewing difference enables us to find the difference in content between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Instead of saving a file into different file names, we can store it with a single file name, and access previous versions easily.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
We can decide when to commit based on a logical change. We might forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs is centric to general docs. While git concentrates in projects where multiple files are involved.s

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log is used to view the stats about when the commit was made, by who and when. It also displays the number of lines added and removed.

Git diff commid_id_1 commit_id_2 is used to view the difference between the two commits.
